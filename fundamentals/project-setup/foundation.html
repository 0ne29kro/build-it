This is informational.---# Page 27: Creating requirements.txt## What this page doesShows how to create a requirements.txt file.---## Where this fitsYou understand what requirements.txt is. Now create one.---## Code (this page)```bashpip3 freeze > requirements.txt```---## ExplanationFirst, make sure you're in your projects folder:```bashcd ~/projects```Then run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`.- `pip3 freeze` lists all installed packages with versions- `>` redirects output to a file- `requirements.txt` is the filenameView the file:```bashcat requirements.txt```---## Why this mattersThis is how you document your project's dependencies for others (or yourself later).---## Checkpoint- [ ] I ran `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`- [ ] Running `cat requirements.txt` shows package list---## If something breaks here- Empty file: No packages installed (that's okay for now)- `No such file or directory`: Make sure you're in a folder you can write to---# Page 28: Installing from requirements.txt## What this page doesShows how to install all packages from requirements.txt.---## Where this fitsYou created a requirements.txt. Now use one.---## Code (this page)```bashpip3 install -r requirements.txt```---## ExplanationThe `-r` flag tells pip to read from a file.pip will install every package listed in requirements.txt.This is how you:- Set up a project someone shared with you- Restore your environment on a new computer- Match a teammate's setup exactly---## Why this mattersOne command installs everything. No manual package-by-package installation.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I understand `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` installs from a file- [ ] I can use this when setting up projects---## If something breaks here- `No such file`: Make sure requirements.txt exists in current folder- Version conflicts: The file may have outdated versions---# Page 29: pip Checkpoint## What this page doesVerifies you understand pip and package management.---## Where this fitsYou have completed the pip section.---## ExplanationYou should now be able to:| Task | Command ||------|---------|| Install a package | `pip3 install packagename` || List packages | `pip3 list` || Uninstall a package | `pip3 uninstall packagename` || Save dependencies | `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` || Install from file | `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` |---## Why this mattersPackage management is essential for every Python project.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I can install packages with pip3- [ ] I can list installed packages- [ ] I can create and use requirements.txt---## If something breaks hereReview pages 21-28 for any command you're unsure about.---# Page 30: What Is a Virtual Environment?## What this page doesExplains why virtual environments exist.---## Where this fitsYou can install packages globally. But that causes problems.---## Explanation**Problem:** Different projects need different package versions.- Project A needs `requests==2.25.0`- Project B needs `requests==2.31.0`If you install globally, one project breaks.**Solution:** Virtual environments.A **venv** is an isolated Python environment. Each project gets its own:- Python interpreter- Installed packages- requirements.txtProjects don't interfere with each other.---## Why this mattersProfessional Python development requires virtual environments. Always use them.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I understand global packages can cause conflicts- [ ] I understand venv isolates each project---## If something breaks hereNothing to break. This is informational.---# Page 31: Creating a venv## What this page doesCreates your first virtual environment.---## Where this fitsYou understand why venv matters. Now create one.---## Code (this page)```bashcd ~/projectsmkdir my-first-projectcd my-first-projectpython3 -m venv venv```---## ExplanationStep by step:1. `cd ~/projects` — Go to your projects folder2. `mkdir my-first-project` — Create a project folder3. `cd my-first-project` — Enter the folder4. `python3 -m venv venv` — Create a virtual environmentThe `-m venv` runs Python's venv module. The second `venv` is the folder name (convention).Check it was created:```bashls```You should see a `venv` folder.---## Why this mattersEvery project should start with creating a venv.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I created a folder `my-first-project`- [ ] I ran `python3 -m venv venv`- [ ] Running `ls` shows a `venv` folder---## If something breaks here- `No module named venv`: Run `brew install python` again- Permission denied: Check folder permissions---# Page 32: Activating the venv## What this page doesShows how to activate your virtual environment.---## Where this fitsYou created a venv. Now activate it.---## Code (this page)```bashsource venv/bin/activate```---## ExplanationType `source venv/bin/activate` and press Enter.Your prompt changes:```(venv) username@MacBook-Pro my-first-project %```The `(venv)` prefix means the virtual environment is active.Now when you run `pip3 install`, packages go into this venv only.---## Why this mattersYou must activate the venv before working on a project. Otherwise packages install globally.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I ran `source venv/bin/activate`- [ ] My prompt shows `(venv)` at the beginning---## If something breaks here- `No such file`: Make sure you're in the folder containing `venv`- Wrong path: It's `venv/bin/activate` not `venv/activate`---# Page 33: Deactivating the venv## What this page doesShows how to exit the virtual environment.---## Where this fitsThe venv is active. Now learn to deactivate it.---## Code (this page)```bashdeactivate```---## ExplanationType `deactivate` and press Enter.Your prompt returns to normal:```username@MacBook-Pro my-first-project %```The `(venv)` prefix is gone. You are back to the global Python.---## Why this mattersWhen switching projects, deactivate one venv before activating another.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I ran `deactivate`- [ ] The `(venv)` prefix is gone from my prompt---## If something breaks here- `command not found`: You weren't in an active venv- This command only works when a venv is active---# Page 34: Why Use venv?## What this page doesSummarizes the benefits of virtual environments.---## Where this fitsYou can create, activate, and deactivate venvs. Understand why.---## ExplanationAlways use venv because:| Benefit | Explanation ||---------|-------------|| **Isolation** | Project A's packages don't affect Project B || **Reproducibility** | requirements.txt captures exact versions || **Clean uninstall** | Delete the venv folder, everything's gone || **No sudo** | Install packages without admin rights || **Version testing** | Test different package versions easily |**Best practice:** Create a venv as the first step for every new project.---## Why this mattersProfessional developers always use virtual environments. It's an industry standard.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I understand the benefits of using venv- [ ] I will create a venv for every project---## If something breaks hereNothing to break. This is informational.---# Page 35: venv Checkpoint## What this page doesVerifies you can manage virtual environments.---## Where this fitsYou have completed the venv section.---## ExplanationYou should now be able to:| Task | Command ||------|---------|| Create a venv | `python3 -m venv venv` || Activate (Mac) | `source venv/bin/activate` || Deactivate | `deactivate` || Check if active | Look for `(venv)` in prompt |**Typical workflow:**```bashmkdir new-projectcd new-projectpython3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip3 install requestspip3 freeze > requirements.txt```---## Why this mattersThis workflow is the foundation of every Python project.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I can create a virtual environment- [ ] I can activate and deactivate it- [ ] I understand when to use venv (always)---## If something breaks hereReview pages 30-34 for any concept you're unsure about.---# Page 36: Final Verification## What this page doesConfirms you have mastered all skills in this guide.---## Where this fitsThis is the end. Verify everything works together.---## ExplanationComplete this final test:```bashcd ~/projectsmkdir test-projectcd test-projectpython3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip3 install requestspip3 freeze > requirements.txtcat requirements.txtpython3 -c "import requests; print('Success!')"deactivate```If you see "Success!" — you have completed the guide.**You can now:**- Navigate with Terminal- Install and run Python- Manage packages with pip- Isolate projects with venv---## Why this mattersYou are ready to build Python projects. This foundation supports everything you'll create.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I completed the final test- [ ] I saw "Success!" printed- [ ] I am ready to start building projects---## If something breaks here- Review the specific section where the error occurred- Each skill builds on the previous one---## Congratulations!You have completed **Project Setup: Foundation**.You are ready to build Python projects on your Mac.**Next:** Learn VS Code to write code more efficiently.</h1>
