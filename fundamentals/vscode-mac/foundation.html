        <h1 class="page-title">Syntax Highlighting## What this page doesShows how VS Code colors your code for readability.---## Where this fitsPython extension installed. Now see it in action.---## ExplanationOpen `hello.py` or create a new Python file with:```pythondef greet(name):    message = f"Hello, {name}!"    print(message)greet("World")```Notice the colors:- **Purple/Blue** — Keywords (`def`, `print`)- **Yellow** — Function names- **Green** — Strings- **White** — VariablesColors vary by theme but always distinguish code elements.---## Why this mattersSyntax highlighting makes code readable. Errors become obvious when colors are wrong.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I see different colors for different code elements- [ ] Keywords, strings, and functions have distinct colors---## If something breaks here- No colors: Make sure file is saved as `.py` (check Status Bar shows "Python")- Wrong colors: The Python extension may still be loading, wait a moment---# Page 22: IntelliSense: Autocomplete## What this page doesDemonstrates VS Code's intelligent code completion.---## Where this fitsSyntax highlighting works. Now experience autocomplete.---## Code (this page)```pythonimport osos.```---## ExplanationType `import os` and press Enter.Then type `os.` (with the dot).A popup appears showing all available methods:- `os.path`- `os.getcwd`- `os.listdir`- ...and moreUse arrow keys to browse, Enter to select, Escape to dismiss.Start typing to filter: `os.getc` shows only methods starting with "getc".---## Why this mattersIntelliSense saves typing and prevents typos. You don't need to memorize every method.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I typed `os.` and saw the autocomplete popup- [ ] I can navigate with arrow keys- [ ] I selected an option with Enter---## If something breaks here- No popup: Press `Control + Space` to manually trigger- Limited options: Python extension may still be indexing, wait a moment---# Page 23: Error Squiggles## What this page doesShows how VS Code highlights errors in your code.---## Where this fitsAutocomplete works. Now see error detection.---## Code (this page)```pythonpritn("Hello")```---## ExplanationType `pritn("Hello")` (intentional typo).A red squiggly line appears under `pritn`. This indicates an error.Hover your mouse over the squiggle to see the error message:- "Undefined name 'pritn'"Fix it to `print` and the squiggle disappears.Yellow squiggles indicate warnings (not errors, but worth checking).---## Why this mattersCatching errors while typing saves debugging time later.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I typed `pritn` and saw a red squiggle- [ ] I hovered and saw the error message- [ ] Fixing to `print` removed the squiggle---## If something breaks here- No squiggles: The linter may be disabled. Install Pylance extension.- Takes time: Error checking runs after a short delay---# Page 24: Selecting a Python Interpreter## What this page doesShows how to choose which Python VS Code uses.---## Where this fitsError detection works. Now configure the Python version.---## Code (this page)```Command + Shift + PType: Python: Select InterpreterPress Enter```---## ExplanationVS Code needs to know which Python to use.1. Open Command Palette (`Command + Shift + P`)2. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"3. Press Enter4. Choose from the list:   - Global Python (`/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`)   - Virtual environment (`./venv/bin/python`)If you're in a project with a venv, select the venv Python.The selected interpreter shows in the Status Bar.---## Why this mattersSelecting the right interpreter ensures VS Code uses the correct Python and packages.---## Checkpoint- [ ] I opened Python: Select Interpreter- [ ] I see a list of Python installations- [ ] I selected one (preferably a venv if available)---## If something breaks here- No interpreters listed: Python not installed, complete Project Setup guide- venv not listed: Make sure the venv exists in your open folder---# Page 25: Running Python Files## What this page doesShows multiple ways to run Python files.---## Where this fitsInterpreter selected.
